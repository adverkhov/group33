# Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh - Group 33

## Overview
This repository contains the project files for the University of Pittsburgh CMPINF 0010 final project. Our group (Group 33) aims to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using data-driven analysis based on multiple metrics defined by each group member.

## Team Members
- Anthony Hoang - alh549@pitt.edu  
- Youssef Bey - yob27@pitt.edu  
- Andrew Malfregeot - ajm620@pitt.edu  
- Allan Verkhov - alv182@pitt.edu  

## Project Description
Our project defines the "best" neighborhood by combining four submetrics, each analyzed individually by a group member using publicly available Pittsburgh datasets from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC). The combined metric ranks Pittsburgh neighborhoods and makes a data-driven argument for the best neighborhood.

## Datasets
Below are the datasets we are using for our analysis. Each dataset corresponds to one submetric analyzed by a group member:

- **Anthony Hoang**: Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) Data - Measures daily air quality in Allegheny County  
  Link: [Allegheny County Air Quality](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality)  

- **Youssef Bey**: City of Pittsburgh Playgrounds - Data on playground locations and features in Pittsburgh neighborhoods  
  Link: [City of Pittsburgh Playgrounds](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playgrounds)  

- **Andrew Malfregeot**: City of Pittsburgh Pools - Locations and details of public pools in Pittsburgh

- **Allan Verkhov**: Allegheny County Fatal Accidental Overdoses - Data tracking overdose fatalities

## Presentation Format
- Group presentation will be during the last lab weeks, lasting about 10 minutes total with 5 minutes for Q&A  
- Each member should be prepared to present the part of the project they contributed, ideally by walking through their individual Jupyter notebook  
- Notebooks should have clear introductions, metric explanations, data analyses, visualizations, and narrative discussions  

## How to Use
