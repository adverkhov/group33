# Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh - Group 33

## Overview
This repository contains the project files for the University of Pittsburgh CMPINF 0010 final project. Our group (Group 33) aims to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using data-driven analysis based on multiple metrics defined by each group member.

## Project Description
Our project defines the "best" neighborhood by combining four submetrics, each analyzed individually by a group member using publicly available Pittsburgh datasets from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC). The combined metric ranks Pittsburgh neighborhoods and makes a data-driven argument for the best neighborhood.

## Datasets  
Below are the datasets we used for our analysis. Each dataset corresponds to one submetric analyzed by a group member:

- **Anthony Hoang**: School Enrollment by Neighborhood
